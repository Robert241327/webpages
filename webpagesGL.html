    <h2>Welcome to my about me page</h2>
  </header>

  <!-- Personalized welcome message -->
  <p>As a Computer and Electrical Engineering student at NC State, I’ve learned to balance demanding technical courses with leadership and communication skills. My weeks are full of challenging classes like Physics and Calculus II, along with opportunities to develop through the Chancellor’s Leadership Development Program. Between labs, lectures, and tutoring sessions, I’ve learned that success in engineering comes from consistency and curiosity. I try to connect what I learn in class to real-world applications, whether it’s circuits, programming, or problem-solving in teams.</p>
